# Zebra-Printer-App
Web app to print shelf labels from Zebra ZD421

## TODO (no particular order)
1. Make front end look nicer
2. When a get request is made to /label delete the json
3. update python client to keep polling until something is found
4. Maybe stop quaggla once its processed a upc and add a button to allow user to retry scanning of upc
